/*
   JAVASCRIPT PRACTICE
   -- Each of the problems below ask you to write code in JavaScript. 
   -- Behind the scenes, a file called 'test.spec.js' will check to see
        if you return the correct values. 

   -- To run these tests and see the results, you simply need to open this 
        folder in a browser. The index page will show your results.

   -- NOTE:
        If you have a syntax error anywhere in your code (e.g. missing brace), all tests will fail. Open your console in the browser to 
        find the line on which you have an error. Mentors can help with this.

// Incorrect Answer
   function speakFalsehood() {
      return "Brian is amazing"
   }
